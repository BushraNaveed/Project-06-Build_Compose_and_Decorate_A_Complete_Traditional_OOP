# ðŸ§± Build, Compose, and Decorate: A Complete Traditional OOP in Python

Welcome to a comprehensive Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project built through **21 hands-on assignments**. This repository serves as a practical guide to mastering traditional OOP concepts using Pythonâ€”from fundamentals to advanced patterns like decorators, composition, and custom iterables.
